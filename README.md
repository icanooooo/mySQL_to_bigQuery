**Ingesting MySQL data and loading it to BigQuery**

This is a repository for an Exercise from my data Engineering Bootcamp from Purwadhika.

I have been tasked to ingest data from an open <a href='relational-db.org'>database</a> and to load it to bigquery. Due to how fun it's to work on this I want to put it on git for everyone to see what i've learned. Any comments are welcomed, thank you!
